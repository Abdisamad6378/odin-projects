      <h1>Description</h1>
      <p>These Boursin scrambled eggs, silky smooth with a subtle savory flavor, are what I like to make for breakfast or brunch when we have overnight friends or family visiting. We enjoy them served with sautéed mushrooms and sliced tomatoes on the side.</p>
      <h1>ingredients</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons half-and-half</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons garlic and fine herbs spreadable cheese (such as Boursin®), cold and crumbled</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>chopped fresh parsley or chives, for garnish</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Steps</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>Whisk eggs, half-and-half, and a pinch of salt together in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a medium nonstick pan over medium-low heat. When butter starts to bubble, pour in egg mixture. Using a silicone spatula, gently swirl the eggs around in circles from the outside in, without stopping, until you start to see small curds, about 20 to 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Switch from making circles to making long sweeps across the pan until you see larger curds, about 20 seconds. When eggs are about 75% cooked, gently fold in crumbled cheese. The eggs now should be softly set and still a little runny in places.</li>
        <li>Remove the skillet from the heat, and set aside for about 20 to 35 seconds to allow the residual heat to finish cooking to your preferred consistency.</li>
        <li>Garnish with parsley or chives, and serve immediately.</li>
      </ol>
